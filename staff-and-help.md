## Asking Questions and Getting Help

There are 17 staff members (instructor, TAs, and tutors) to help with your
learning, and a few different ways to get in touch and ask for help.

  - **Office hours**: Wednesday 10:00am-11:00am, Friday 10:00am-11:00am, CSE 4204

Do NOT use the Canvas mailing feature to contact us. We will NOT respond to those
messages. If you need to send a private message to the instructor, you can use his ucsd email
address (but any course related questions should ideally be through Piazza).

## Message Board Questions

You can post questions on our Piazza message board at any time:
[https://piazza.com/class/lfkeh7em1lb7n3/](https://piazza.com/class/lfkeh7em1lb7n3/){:target="_blank"}

The message board is a good place for questions about something that was
confusing in class, in videos, in the book, or generally about course content.
It's not always the best place for help with programming details on your
assignments (remote or in-person lab hours are better for that). If you do post
for help with a programming assignment, we ask that you use good judgment in how
much code you share ‚Äì sharing too much as part of your question could harm
others' learning if they aren't expecting to see parts of a solution. 

Feel free to engage with your classmates and help answer their questions. Always
be polite and assume the best intentions. Always assume that the person you're
talking to is asking an honest question, and don't assume they ‚Äúshould know‚Äù
something; if they seem to not know something from the course, reminding them
with a link to where it was taught can be useful (instead of saying something
like ‚Äúthat was already covered‚Äù). Try to guide your classmates to useful
conclusions on their own rather than solving their problems for them. Using
emoji can always help with a positive and friendly vibe üôÇ

During the times where we have take-home programming exams, Piazza will not
allow posting public to the class.

## FAQs

**Do I have to participate if I'm on the waitlist?**

Yes, you're responsible for everything as if you're a normally-enrolled student
while you're on the waitlist, including any submission deadlines, and your work
will be graded as usual.

**I have a question about enrollments and the waitlist.**

Please contact [CSE student
affairs](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate/advising/cse-student-affairs-office-hours){:target="_blank"},
who can give the best advice and information about the enrollment process. They
are friendly and helpful and know much more about timing and any updates you
will see through the registration system.

There is some useful advice at [Enrolling in CSE
Courses](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/courses/enrolling-cse-courses){:target="_blank"} that
likely summarizes a lot of what they would tell you to get you started.

**What's the course material like?**

You can see a [previous version of the
course](https://ucsd-cse12-f22.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, which will give you a sense. This
offering will not be identical, but will be similar.

There is no required textbook for you to purchase for the course. The course uses a combination of online resources and notes from the instructors.

**Can I audit the course?**

You can use all the public resources on this website, and if you're a UCSD
community member, you can view all the podcasts for the problem sessions at
[https://podcast.ucsd.edu/](https://podcast.ucsd.edu/). Beyond that we don't
have any formalized support for auditing the course.

**Do we need a clicker for this class?**

No. We use Gradescope to collect worksheets for lecture participation credit.

**Where are the icons from?**

Icons made by <a href="https://www.freepik.com" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a>.
